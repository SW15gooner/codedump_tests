# python_tests
I am a 25+ year Network Engineer who has driven everything via CLI/GUI, and used Bash, Batch, VBS (in the old days), Powershell and more. But haven't really done any Python.

Since this Covid stuff, I have been slowly learning Python while working.

Here is a collection of random smatterings. There is no obvious structure here, this is a dumping ground. I will attempt to comment each file and add descriptions elsewhere.
